# Generic-Feedback-System
A generic feedback system developed using HTML, CSS, JAVA SCRIPT for front-end and mySQL for database back-end.
Complete code for the same has been uploaded. It is a fully functional generic feedback system as it can be implemented for any organisation. This project was created for the Smart India Hackathon Grand Finale-2017.

This particular version has 3 interfaces, one for the students, one for the faculty and one for the administrator.
The student interface is designed to take feedback input while the faculty interface displays the cummulative result of the feedback as entered by all students.
The administrator interface gives the administrator the power to edit what information is made availabe to which faculty.

The database is stored using mySQL and the administrator has the access to the database.
